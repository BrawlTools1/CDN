Visualized maps are generated using a customized *currently* private [bloodwiing/BrawlMapGen](https://github.com/bloodwiing/BrawlMapGen) update.

All maps are linked by their appropriate IDs you can find in [locations](https://api.brawlify.com/game/csv_logic/locations) and other endpoints from [the official API](https://developer.brawlstars.com/) or [BrawlAPI](https://brawlapi.com/)

# Standards

## regular
Maps generated here are as close as possible to in-game map images with the same or similar environments, optimized to be just big enough for comfortable zooming but not big enough where they waste too much disk space / bandwidth.
