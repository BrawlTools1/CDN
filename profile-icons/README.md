Profile icons are linked by their appropriate IDs you can find in [player_thumbnails](https://api.brawlify.com/game/csv_logic/player_thumbnails) and other endpoints from [the official API](https://developer.brawlstars.com/) or [BrawlAPI](https://brawlapi.com/)

# Standards

## regular
Unmodified larger profile icons in appropriate borders. 200x200 and larger

> [!NOTE]
> Some icons are unfortunately not available right after an update release from our sources, which means it takes a little while to find them and upload them here. These new icons will temporarily be redirected to the [`Unknown.png`](/profile-icons/regular/Unknown.png) icon in their place. On websites it's better to have a placeholder icon rather than a `404 Not Found` error, as it impacts SEO and browsing experience.
