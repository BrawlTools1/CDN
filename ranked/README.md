Ranked icons are linked by their appropriate IDs you can find in [ranked_ranks](https://api.brawlify.com/game/csv_logic/ranked_ranks) or their respective names, based on the standard you choose. This will likely be available in some endpoints from [the official API](https://developer.brawlstars.com/) or [BrawlAPI](https://brawlapi.com/)

# Standards

## regular
Linked by respective names for each icon, only includes the base, not the number / tier.

## tiered
Linked by IDs found in [ranked_ranks](https://api.brawlify.com/game/csv_logic/ranked_ranks) and other API endpoints, with appropriate tier number at the bottom.
